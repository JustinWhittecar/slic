CHOOSE WEIGHT (TONNAGE)
Under these rules, BattleMechs may measure 20 to 100 tons in 
weight (increasing in 5-ton increments). Within these limits, the 
player may choose any tonnage. The total weight of the BattleM-
ech’s engine, weapons, armor and other components may not 
exceed this amount. Nor should it fall below; under these rules, 
any unspent weight left over after the creation process is classi-
fied as wasted tonnage.
Andrew decides his Mongoose will be 
a lightweight scout. Light BattleMechs 
weigh between 20 and 35 tons, so he 
chooses to set his Mongoose at 25 tons.
Brent’s Gladiator is to be a mass of 
devastating firepower few can withstand. 
Choosing the assault weight class, Brent 
decides this ’Mech will weigh in at 95 
tons—nearly the heaviest mass possible.
Chas chooses a heavy weight class for 
his Barghest, giving him a range of 60 to 
75 tons to choose from. He selects a total 
mass of 70 tons for his machine.
ALLOCATE TONNAGE FOR INTERNAL STRUCTURE
Every BattleMech has an internal structure, which represents 
its skeleton and joints. The weight of this structure depends on 
the weight of the BattleMech, as well as on whether the designer 
chooses a standard or endo-steel frame. Standard structure 
weighs 10 percent of the BattleMech’s total weight, while endo-
steel weighs half as much (rounded up to the nearest half ton).
The BattleMech’s total mass also determines the number of 
internal structure points each location receives. When using the 
blank ’Mech Record Sheet, the designer must mark out any excess 
circles on the Internal Structure Diagram, leaving behind only the 
number of circles in each location equal to the number of internal 
structure points in that location.
BattleMech internal structure points are fixed to their assigned 
locations, based on the weight and body type of the ’Mech itself. 
These points may not be redistributed elsewhere.
The maximum amount of armor points a BattleMech may carry 
(called its Maximum Armor Factor) is directly determined by the 
number of internal structure points per section. All locations 
except the head may carry a maximum of twice the number of 
armor points as they have internal structure points, including any 
armor placed in rear locations (see Add Armor, p. 54). All head loca-
tions may receive a maximum of 9 armor points.
The BattleMech Internal Structure Table at right provides the 
mass of internal structure (standard and endo-steel) for all legal 
BattleMech tonnages, as well as the number of internal structure 
circles each location must have. Also provided (for designer refer-
The above design process is a mere framework for designing 
a BattleMech. The actual process—particularly after the chassis, 
engine and control systems are determined—can involve a bit 
more flexibility as weapons, armor and heat sinks are balanced 
for their best fit in terms of weight and space. For instance, some 
designers might wish to assign armor as soon as they have chosen 
the engine and chassis, perhaps to maximize the ’Mech’s protec-
tion before dealing with heat sinks and weapons. Others may 
want to choose weapons before adding more heat sinks, to see 
how many might be needed in addition to those that come free 
with the engine.
To assist in this effort, the designer may find it useful to make 
copies of the ’Mech Record Sheet (in the back of this book), to 
visually arrange the placement of weapons and equipment while 
tracking the use of tonnage on a piece of scratch paper. Alterna-
tively, designers with access to the HeavyMetal Pro software can 
use it to develop their BattleMechs on their PCs.
STEP 1: DESIGN THE CHASSIS
The first step in BattleMech design is the creation of the ’Mech’s 
basic framework, or chassis. This step establishes some of the most 
basic aspects of the BattleMech’s design, determining what kind 
of ’Mech it is, its technology base, its weight and the design type 
(biped or four-legged). These choices will restrict the designer’s 
access to certain equipment, and will also determine the weight 
and bulk of the ’Mech’s internal structure. 
CHOOSE TECHNOLOGY BASE
BattleMechs may be constructed using Clan or Inner Sphere 
technology bases. ’Mechs designed using either technology base 
may be built as OmniMechs.
Andrew is designing a BattleMech that 
he has dubbed the MON-66 Mongoose. 
Because he plans to create this design for 
an old Star League-era game, before the 
time of the Clans, he chooses an Inner 
Sphere technology base, and notes that 
the design will not be an OmniMech.
Brent is designing a BattleMech, which 
he has named the Gladiator (Clan name: 
Executioner). He has chosen the Clan 
technology base for this design, and has 
elected to make it an OmniMech.
Chas is designing a four-legged Bat-
tleMech that he has chosen to name the 
BGS-1T Barghest. As this will be a modern 
Lyran-made design, he has chosen an 
Inner Sphere technology base, and has 
opted not to make it an Omni.

For Andrew’s Mongoose, weight is 
at a premium, so he chooses to install 
endo-steel internal structure on his 
BattleMech. At 25 tons in total weight, 
the Mongoose’s endo-steel internal 
structure weighs 1.5 tons, leaving 
23.5 tons to play with [25 – 1.5 = 23.5]. 
This endo-steel construction will 
require 14 slots on the Critical Hit 
Table, but Andrew opts to wait until later to distribute 
them. In the meantime, Andrew blacks out all extrane-
ous circles from the Internal Structure Diagram on his 
Mongoose’s Record Sheet, leaving only 8 open circles 
in the center torso, 6 circles each in the left and right 
torsos, 6 circles in each leg and 4 in each arm. (As all 
heads receive 3 points of structure automatically, 
Andrew leaves the head’s internal structure alone.)
To devote as much internal space 
as possible, Brent opts for standard 
internal structure on his Gladiator, 
confident that the more efficient 
weight of Clan weaponry will allow 
him to arm the OmniMech to the 
teeth without undue expense. Stan-
dard internal structure for a 95-ton 
ence) is the maximum possible armor factor for BattleMechs 
at each tonnage, for biped and four-legged designs.
Technology Base: Standard internal structure is equally 
available to BattleMechs of Clan or Inner Sphere technology 
bases. Inner Sphere endo-steel is available only to BattleMechs 
with an Inner Sphere Tech Base. Clan endo-steel is available 
only to BattleMechs with a Clan Tech Base.
Four-legged: BattleMechs built as quads have four legs, 
rather than two arms and two legs. The number of internal 
structure points for all four legs is thus determined by the Legs 
(Each) column appropriate to the ’Mech’s tonnage. The Arms 
(Each) column has no bearing on quads.
Space: If the design uses endo-steel internal structure, Inner 
Sphere ‘Mech designs must assign 14 critical slots on the Bat-
tleMech’s Critical Hit Table to endo-steel (Clan designs assign 
only 7 slots). The location of these slots need not be contiguous, 
nor do they need to be determined at this stage. However, they 
must be assigned by the final stages of design, while allocating 
weapons, heat sinks and any other equipment not otherwise 
preset (such as engines, gyros and cockpit systems).
OmniMechs: The type of internal structure and placement of 
any critical slots required must be determined upon the design of 
the base configuration. All complete primary and alternate con-
figurations thereafter must use the same number in any given 
bodily location for their slots, although it is permissible to shift 
the slots within a location when designing a new configuration.

## BATTLE VALUE SECTION (Pages 304-325)

--- PAGE 304 ---
The Battle Value (BV) system provides a numerical rating that 
represents the capabilities and survivability of every BattleTech unit: 
BattleMechs, IndustrialMechs, Combat Vehicles, Support Vehicles, 
aerospace fighters, conventional fighters, DropShips, Small Craft, 
ProtoMechs, conventional infantry and battle armor. With the Battle 
Value system, players can create fairly well matched battles by assem-
bling two opposing forces, each with the same total BV ratings (see 
Constructing a Battle Force, p. 315) and equivalent force sizes. The BV 
ratings for combat-effective weapons and equipment are listed in 
the Inner Sphere, Clan and Conventional Infantry Weapons Battle 
Value tables at the end of this section, beginning on page 317.
The formulas in this section allow players to calculate the exact 
BV of any BattleMech, vehicle or other unit. However, the variety 
of hardware and units encompassed by BattleTech precludes an 
easy-to-use system. Players may find some of the formulas com-
plex, and space prohibits a detailed analysis of the methods by 
which equipment values and other modifiers are derived.
This revised Battle Value system replaces the system first published 
in Maximum Tech and the BattleTech Master Rules. A list of Battle Values 
for all units with a published Record Sheet can be found on Catalyst 
Game Labs’ Master Unit List website (http://www.masterunitlist.info/).
CALCULATING ’MECH BV
BattleMechs and IndustrialMechs share the same method of 
calculating their BV ratings, involving three main steps. First, cal-
culate the ’Mech’s Defensive Battle Rating (DBR). Second, calculate 
the Offensive Battle Rating (OBR). Finally, add the Defensive and 
Offensive Battle Ratings together for a combined BV and then 
round to the nearest whole number (round .5 up) to obtain the 
final BV. As you read each step, refer to pages 304–305 for an 
example of calculating the BV for a MON-66 Mongoose, a TDR-
10SE Thunderbolt and a WI-DM DemolitionMech.
STEP 1: CALCULATE DEFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
First, ADD the following figures:
Total Armor Factor x 2.5 x Armor Type Modifier
Consult the ’Mech Armor Type Modifier Table on page 315.
Total Internal Structure Points x 1.5 x Internal Structure Type 
Modifier x Engine Type Modifier
Consult the ’Mech Internal Structure Type Modifier Table on p. 
315 and the ’Mech Engine Type Modifier Table on page 315.
Gyro (’Mech Tonnage x ’Mech Gyro Modifier)
Consult the ’Mech Gyro Type Modifier Table on page 315.
Total BV of all Defensive Equipment
Defensive Equipment includes active probes, anti-missile 
system (including AMS ammo up to the BV of the systems them-
selves), antipersonnel pods, anti-battle armor pods, bridgelayers 
and ECM suites. All TechManual Defensive Equipment is identified 
on the Weapon and Equipment Battle Value Tables by a dagger 
footnote (†).
Then SUBTRACT the following figures. These subtractions can-
not drop the running total below 1.
15 points per critical space of explosive ammo in the center 
torso, legs or head (Clan ’Mech)
15 points per critical space of explosive ammo in any loca-
tion (’Mech with Inner Sphere XL engine)
15 points per critical space of explosive ammo in the center 
torso, legs or head, or not protected by CASE* in its location (Inner 
Sphere ’Mech with Standard or Light engines)

15 points per critical space of explosive ammo in arm 
not protected by CASE* in its location, or in the next location 
inward on the Damage Transfer Diagram (see p. 123, TW)

tected by CASE* in its location, or in the next location inward 
on the Damage Transfer Diagram (see p. 123, TW) (Inner 
Sphere ’Mechs with standard or light engines)
Note: Explosive ammo is any ammunition that may explode 
inside a ’Mech. Gauss weapons include Gauss rifles, HAGs and 
AP Gauss.
* – It is assumed Clan ’Mechs have CASE installed. If the 
design specifically did not pay the C-bill cost to install CASE 
then treat a Clan-built ’Mech as an Inner Sphere ’Mech for the 
purpose of these calculations.
Calculate ’Mech’s Defensive Battle Rating
MULTIPLY the current total by the ’Mech’s Defensive Factor. 
A ’Mech’s Defensive Factor is based on the unit’s highest poten-
tial target modifier (including bonuses for jump capability, 
enhanced movement capability from MASC or triple-strength 
myomer, and the maximum effects of stealth armor, such as 
the modifier for long range), as shown on the Defensive Fac-
tors Table and Defensive Factor Modifier Table (p. 316). The final 
result is the ’Mech’s Defensive Battle Rating (DBR).
STEP 2: CALCULATE OFFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
To calculate the Offensive Battle Rating, first calculate the 
Modified Battle Value of each weapon on the ’Mech. Then, 
make any required adjustments for the ’Mech’s Heat Efficiency, 
offensive equipment, and tonnage to get the ’Mech’s Weapon 
Battle Rating. Multiply the Weapon Battle Rating by the 
’Mech’s Speed Factor: the result is the Offensive Battle Rating.
Calculate Each Weapon’s Modified BV 
First, determine the Battle Value of each weapon and its 
ammunition (if applicable) carried by the ’Mech (see pp. 317-
318). Then apply the following BV modifiers as necessary. All 
modifiers are cumulative. The result is the weapon’s Modified 
BV, which is used in the steps that follow.
Excessive Ammunition: To prevent excessive ammo from 
distorting the Battle Value, the BV added for ammunition can-
not exceed the unmodified BV of the weapon itself. If the BV 
of the ammo exceeds the weapon BV, reduce the ammo BV to 
equal the unmodified weapon BV. When a ’Mech carries sev-
eral weapons of the same model, total the unmodified BV for 
all examples of that model and then the BV for all ammunition 
carried for that model before comparing the two BVs.
Rear-Firing Weapons: Rear-firing torso-, leg- and head-
mounted weapons (but not their ammunition) count as half 
their normal BV value. If the unmodified BV of forward-firing 
weapons in those locations is less than the unmodified BV of 
rear-firing weapons, then halve the value of the forward-firing 
torso-, leg- and head-mounted weapons instead. When mak-
ing heat adjustments to a weapon’s BV (see below), switch the 
forward- and rear-firing arcs in an identical manner.
Artemis IV FCS: Increase by 20 percent the BV of any mis-
sile launcher equipped with Artemis IV. This increase does not 
apply to the launcher’s ammunition.
Targeting Computer: Each weapon linked to a targeting 
computer (see p. 238) multiplies its BV by 1.25. Do not include 
ammunition when adjusting linked weapon BVs.
Determine ’Mech Heat Efficiency and Total Weapon Heat
Determine ’Mech Heat Efficiency: A weapon’s Modified BV 
may need to be reduced to take into consideration the ’Mech’s 
Heat Efficiency. To calculate ’Mech Heat Efficiency, add 6 to 
the unit’s Heat Sink Capacity and subtract the heat generated 
when the ’Mech moves.
’Mech Heat Efficiency = 6 + Heat Sink Capacity – Movement Heat
Heat Sink Capacity: Heat Sink Capacity denotes the maxi-
mum number of Heat Points a ’Mech can dissipate in a single 
turn. Each single heat sink dissipates 1 point of heat. Double-
capacity heat sinks dissipate 2 points of heat.
Movement Heat: Movement Heat is the amount of heat 
generated when the ’Mech moves in the most heat-intensive 
manner possible (Running or Jumping at its maximum capac-
ity) during a single turn. If the ’Mech has stealth armor, add 10 to 
this value. ICE-powered IndustrialMechs do not generate heat 
when moving and so always have a Movement Heat Value of 0.
Determine Total Weapon Heat: Determine the total heat 
that the ’Mech would generate if it fired all its offensive weap-
ons, including rear-firing weapons, in a single turn (Defensive 
Equipment is never figured in this value). Multiply by 2 the 
heat points generated by Ultra autocannons, multiply by 6 
the heat points generated by rotary autocannons, reduce by 
half the heat points generated by Streak SRMs and reduce to 
one-quarter the heat points generated by one-shot weapons.
Calculate Weapon Battle Rating
Start a running Weapon Battle Rating total, beginning at 0. 
When instructed, add the specified amount to this total.
1	
Add the Modified BV of any weapon on the ’Mech that 
does not generate heat when fired to the running 
Weapon Battle Rating total.
2	
Add the BV of any ammunition and non-Defensive Equip-
ment on the ’Mech to the running Weapon Battle Rating total.
3	
If the ’Mech’s Total Weapon Heat is equal to or less than 
the ’Mech’s Heat Efficiency, add the Modified BV of all 
the ’Mech’s remaining weapons to the running Weapon 
Battle Rating and proceed to Step 8. If the Total Weapon 
Heat is greater than the ’Mech’s Heat Efficiency, start a 
running heat total, beginning at 0, and proceed to Step 4.
4	
Ignoring weapons that generate no heat when fired, 
choose the weapon on the ’Mech with the highest Modi-
fied BV. If more than one weapon has the same Modified 
BV, choose the one that generates the least heat when 
fired. If multiple weapons of the same type are mounted, 
choose one randomly.

It has no special equipment that modifies the BV of its weapons.

2. Determine ’Mech Heat Efficiency and Total Weapon Heat
The Mongoose has 10 single heat sinks. It cannot jump, and 
so its hottest movement mode is Running (2 points of heat). It is 
armed with 3 Medium Lasers (3 heat each) and 1 Small Laser (1 
heat). Find its ’Mech Heat Efficiency and Total Weapon Heat.

’Mech Heat Efficiency = 6 + 10 - 2 = 14

Total Weapon Heat = 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10
Because the Total Weapon Heat is lower than the ’Mech Heat 
Efficiency, there is no need to reduce the BV of any of its weapons. 
The Weapon Battle Rating is therefore the sum of these weapons’ 
BVs, plus the ’Mech’s tonnage.

3. Calculate Offensive Battle Rating
Multiply the Mongoose’s Weapon Battle Rating by its Speed Fac-
tor. With a maximum Running MP of 12, and no Jumping MP, its 
Speed Factor is 1.89.

172 x 1.89 = 325.08
	

Offensive Battle Rating = 325.08
CALCULATE FINAL BATTLE VALUE

Defensive Battle Rating + Offensive Battle Rating = BV
 

433.3 + 325.08 = 758.38
	
MON-66 Mongoose BV = 758
5	
Add this weapon’s Modified BV to the running Weapon Battle 
Rating total, and add its Heat Value to the running heat total.
6	
If the running heat total is less than the ’Mech Heat Efficiency, 
repeat Steps 4-5 (ignoring any weapons already chosen). If 
the running heat total is equal to or has exceeded the Heat 
Efficiency, proceed to Step 7.
7	
The weapon that causes the ’Mech’s Heat Efficiency to be 
equaled or exceeded is still calculated at its full Modified 
BV. All remaining weapons are then added to the running 
Weapon Battle Rating total at half their Modified BV.
8	
Add the total ’Mech tonnage to the running Weapon Battle 
Rating total. Note: TSM-equipped ’Mechs multiply their ton-
nage by 1.5. Industrial TSM-equipped ’Mechs multiply their 
tonnage by 1.15.
Having followed the steps above, the result is the ’Mech’s 
Weapon Battle Rating. Proceed to the next step, Calculate Offen-
sive Battle Rating.
Calculate Offensive Battle Rating
Determine Speed Factor: A ’Mech’s Speed Factor reflects its 
ability to maneuver on the battlefield. To find the Speed Factor 
of a ’Mech, add together its Running MP and half its Jumping MP 
(rounded up). If the ’Mech has equipment that increases its Run-
ning and/or Jumping MP, such as MASC or triple-strength myomer 
(but not industrial triple-strength myomer), use the maximum MP 
it can legally generate for each movement type. Then consult the 
Speed Factor Table (p. 316).
Multiply the Weapon Battle Rating by the Speed Factor to 
give the Offensive Battle Rating. Note: IndustrialMechs, unless 
equipped with Advanced Fire Control (see p. 69), multiply their 
Offensive Battle Rating by 0.9.
STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL BATTLE VALUE
Calculate a ’Mech’s final BV by adding its Defensive and Offen-
sive Battle Ratings. If the ’Mech is equipped with a Small cockpit, 
multiply this total by .95. Round the remaining fraction to the 
nearest whole number (round .5 up).
This formula yields the Battle Value of a ’Mech piloted by a 
MechWarrior with the standard Gunnery 4 and Piloting 5 Skill 
levels. If the MechWarrior has higher or lower skill levels, multiply 
the BV by the appropriate skill level multiplier (see Constructing a 
Battle Force, p. 315).

2. Determine ’Mech Heat Efficiency and Total Weapon Heat
The DemolitionMech has 1 single heat sink. It cannot jump, 
and so its hottest movement mode is Running (2 points of 
heat). It is armed with 1 Small Laser (1 heat). Find its ’Mech 
Heat Efficiency and Total Weapon Heat.

’Mech Heat Efficiency = 6 + 1 - 2 = 5

Total Weapon Heat = 1
Because the Total Weapon Heat is lower than the ’Mech 
Heat Efficiency, there is no need to reduce the BV of any of its 
weapons. The Weapon Battle Rating is therefore the sum of its 
equipment and weapon BVs, plus the ’Mech’s tonnage.

Multiply the DemolitionMech’s Weapon Battle Rating by 
its Speed Factor. With a maximum Running MP of 5, and no 
Jumping MP, its Speed Factor is 1.00.

58 x 1.00 = 58
Because the DemolitionMech is an IndustrialMech and does 
not have an Advanced Fire Control System, the Offensive

STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL BATTLE VALUE
Players calculate the BV of a ProtoMech by adding the Pro-
toMech’s Defensive and Offensive Battle Ratings. Round the 
remaining fraction to the nearest whole number (.5 rounds up).
This formula yields the Battle Value of a ProtoMech piloted by 
a warrior with the standard Gunnery Skill level of 4. If the warrior 
has a higher or lower skill level, multiply the BV by the appropriate 
skill level multiplier (see Constructing a Battle Force, p. 315).

CALCULATE OFFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
1. Calculate Weapon Battle Rating
The Delphyne-2 is armed with 2 ER Micro Lasers and 2 SRM 3s. 
The Delphyne-2 carries 20 shots for its SRM 3, or 60 missiles, which 
weigh 10 kg each (see p. 88, ProtoMech Ammunition Weight Table).
Ammunition (SRM) 60:
60 x 10 = 600
600 kg is less than a full ton of SRM ammunition so it must cal-
culate the modified BV for its ammunition. SRM 3 ammunition has 
a BV of 4 for each full ton.
600 kg of SRM 3 ammunition:
(600 ÷ 1,000) x 4 = 2.4
No weapon has an ammunition BV greater than the BV of the 
weapon, so no further modifications to BV are needed.

2 SRM-3s:
2 x 30 = 60
Ammunition (SRM) 60 (at full value):

2. Calculate Offensive Battle Rating
Multiply the Delphyne’s Weapon Battle Rating by its Speed Fac-
tor. With a maximum Running MP of 8, and a Jumping MP of 5, its 
Speed Factor is 1.76.
CALCULATING PROTOMECH BV
The procedure for calculating the Battle Value (BV) of a Pro-
toMech is similar to that for ’Mechs. The player first determines 
the ProtoMech’s Defensive and Offensive Battle Ratings and then 
combines them to produce the final BV. In all cases, retain frac-
tions until reaching the final BV, then round to the nearest whole 
number (.5 rounds up). As you read each step, refer to p. 307 for an 
example of calculating the BV for a Delphyne-2.
STEP 1: CALCULATE DEFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
First, ADD the following figures:
Total Armor Factor x 2.5
Total Internal Structure Points x 1.5
Total BV of all Defensive Equipment
Defensive Equipment includes active probes, anti-missile 
systems (including AMS ammo, up to the BV of the systems them-
selves) and ECM suites. All TechManual Defensive Equipment is 
identified on the Weapon and Equipment Battle Value Tables by 
a dagger footnote (†).
Calculate ProtoMech’s Defensive Battle Rating
MULTIPLY the current total by the ProtoMech’s Defensive Fac-
tor. The Defensive Factor is based on the unit’s highest potential 
target modifier (including bonuses for jump capability and the 
use of a ProtoMech myomer booster), as shown on the Defensive 
Factors Table and Defensive Factor Modifier Table (p. 316). Proto-
Mechs add 0.1 to the value from the table.
The final result is the ProtoMech’s Defensive Battle Rating (DBR).
STEP 2: CALCULATE OFFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
To calculate the Offensive Battle Rating, calculate each weapon’s 
BV in order to determine the Weapon Battle Rating. Then MULTIPLY 
the Weapon Battle Rating by the ProtoMech’s Speed Factor.
Calculate Weapon Battle Rating
Determine the Battle Value of each weapon and its ammunition 
(if applicable) carried, as well as any equipment (see pp. 317-318).
Ammunition: If the ProtoMech carries a quantity of ammo other 
than a full ton, divide the kilograms of ammo carried by 1,000, 
then multiply the result by the BV of the ammo per ton. The result 
is the BV for the amount of ammo carried.
To prevent excessive ammo from distorting the Battle Value, the 
BV added for ammunition cannot exceed the BV of the weapon 
itself. If the ammo BV exceeds that of the weapon, reduce the 
ammo BV to match the weapon BV.
Calculate Offensive Battle Rating
Determine Speed Factor: A ProtoMech’s Speed Factor reflects 
its ability to maneuver on the battlefield. To find the Speed Factor, 
add together the ProtoMech’s Running MP and half its Jumping MP 
(rounded up). Add 1 to the result if the ProtoMech is equipped with 
a myomer booster. Then consult the Speed Factor Table (p. 316).
Multiply the Weapon Battle Rating by the listed Speed Factor to 
give the Offensive Battle Rating.

Calculate Each Weapon’s Modified BV 
First, determine the Battle Value of each weapon and its 
ammunition (if applicable) carried (see pp. 317-318). Then 
apply the following BV modifiers as necessary. All modifiers 
are cumulative. The result is the weapon’s Modified BV, which 
is used in the steps that follow.
Support Vehicles: Adjust the Battle Value of all heavy 
weapons and their ammunition by the fire control multiplier 
from the Offensive BV Adjustment Table (see p. 316). Players 
need not adjust light and medium weapons.
Turret-Mounted Weapons: Weapons mounted in a turret 
are not included in any arc, and their full BV value is always 
used.
Excessive Ammunition: To prevent excessive ammo from 
distorting the Battle Value, the BV added for ammunition can-
not exceed the unmodified BV of the weapon itself. If the BV 
of the ammo exceeds the weapon BV, reduce the ammo BV 
to equal the unmodified weapon BV. If the unit has several 
weapons of the same model, total the unmodified BV for all 
examples of that model and then the BV for all ammunition 
carried for that model before comparing the two BVs.
Rear-Firing Weapons: Rear-firing weapons (but not 
their ammunition) count as half their normal BV value. If 
the unmodified BV of forward-arc weapons is less than the 
unmodified BV of rear-arc weapons, then halve the value of 
the forward-arc weapons instead. When making heat adjust-
ments to a weapon’s BV (see below), switch the forward- and 
rear-firing arcs in an identical manner.
Artemis IV FCS: Increase by 20 percent the BV of any mis-
sile launcher equipped with Artemis IV. This increase does not 
apply to the launcher’s ammunition.
Targeting Computer: Each weapon linked to a targeting 
computer (see p. 238) multiplies its BV by 1.25. Do not include 
ammunition when adjusting linked weapon BVs.
Calculate Weapon Battle Rating
Add the Modified BV of all weapons, ammunition and 
equipment. 
Next, ADD total Vehicle tonnage ÷ 2
Calculate Offensive Battle Rating
Determine Speed Factor: Use the Vehicle’s Flanking MP 
rating and consult the Speed Factor Table (p. 316).
Multiply the vehicle’s Weapon Battle Rating and Speed Fac-
tor to determine its Offensive BV. 
STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL BV
Add the Defensive and Offensive Battle Value Ratings and 
round the resulting sum to the nearest whole number. The 
result is the vehicle’s BV.
This formula yields the BV of a vehicle controlled by a crew 
with the standard Gunnery 4 and Piloting/Driving Skill 5. If 
a crew with a different skill level pilots the unit, multiply the 
BV by the appropriate skill level multiplier (see Constructing a 
Battle Force, p. 315).

76.4 x 1.76 = 134.464

Offensive Battle Rating = 134.464
CALCULATE FINAL BATTLE VALUE

Defensive Battle Rating + Offensive Battle Rating = BV

182 + 134.464 = 316.464
	

Delphyne-2 BV = 316
CALCULATING VEHICLE BV
The procedure for calculating the Battle Value (BV) of Com-
bat Vehicles and tracked, wheeled, hover, VTOL, WiGE and 
naval Support Vehicles is similar to that for ’Mechs. First deter-
mine the vehicle’s Defensive and Offensive Battle Ratings, and 
then combine them to produce the final BV. Retain fractions 
until reaching the final BV, then round to the nearest whole 
number (.5 rounds up). As you read each step, refer to page 
308 for an example of calculating the BV for a CellCo Ranger 
APC and a Hephaestus OmniVehicle.
For Airship and Fixed Wing Support Vehicles, use the rules for 
Aerospace units, starting on page 312.
STEP 1: CALCULATE DEFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
First, ADD the following figures:
Total Armor Factor x 2.5
(Support Vehicles: multiply by BAR ÷ 10)
Total Internal Structure Points x 1.5 (including rotor and
turret internal structure)
Total BV of all Defensive Equipment
Defensive Equipment includes active probes, anti-missile 
systems (including AMS ammo, up to the BV of the systems 
themselves) and ECM suites. All TechManual Defensive Equip-
ment is identified on the Weapon and Equipment Battle Value 
Tables by a dagger footnote (†).
Calculate the Vehicle’s Defensive Battle Rating
MULTIPLY the current value by the appropriate modifier 
from the Unit Type Modifiers Table (p. 316). The Unit Type 
Modifier represents a unit’s terrain restrictions and vulner-
abilities to critical damage. Surface vessels, hydrofoils and 
submarines are considered naval vessels for this purpose.
Next, MULTIPLY the current total by the vehicle’s Defensive 
Factor. The Defensive Factor is based on the unit’s highest 
potential target Modifier, as shown on the Defensive Factors 
Table and Defensive Factor Modifier Table (p. 316).
The final result is the vehicle’s Defensive Battle Rating (DBR).
STEP 2: CALCULATE OFFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
To calculate the Offensive Battle Rating, calculate each 
weapon’s Modified BV in order to determine the Weapon 
Battle Rating. Then MULTIPLY the Weapon Battle Rating by 
the Vehicle’s Speed Factor.

CALCULATING CONVENTIONAL 
INFANTRY BV
The process for calculating the Battle Value (BV) of a 
conventional infantry unit is similar to that for ’Mechs and 
vehicles. First determine the unit’s Defensive and Offensive 
Battle Ratings, and then combine them to produce the final 
BV. Retain fractions until reaching the final BV, then round to 
the nearest whole number (.5 rounds up). As you read each 
step, refer to page 310 for an example of calculating the BV for 
an Anti-’Mech Jump Infantry Platoon.
STEP 1: CALCULATE DEFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
MULTIPLY the number of troopers by 1.5 and the unit’s 
Defensive Factor. The Defensive Factor is based on the unit’s 
highest potential target modifier (including bonuses for jump 
capability), as shown on the Defensive Factors Table (p. 316).
The final result is the conventional infantry unit’s Defensive 
Battle Rating.
STEP 2: CALCULATE OFFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
To calculate the Offensive Battle Rating, determine the 
Weapon Battle Rating and then MULTIPLY the result by the 
infantry unit’s Speed Factor.
Calculate Weapon Battle Rating
Add the BV ratings of all individual and support weapons 
(see the Conventional Infantry Weapons BV Table, p. 319). If 
the unit is capable of performing anti-’Mech attacks, add these 
amounts again (all non-mechanized conventional infantry has 
this capability).
Multiply Weapon Battle Rating by Speed Factor
Multiply the unit’s Weapon Battle Rating and Speed Factor 
to determine its Offensive BV Rating. Use the infantry unit’s 
fastest movement mode; for example, jump infantry use their 
Jumping movement.
STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL BATTLE VALUE
Add the Defensive Battle Rating and the Offensive Battle Rat-
ing and round to the nearest whole number (0.5 rounds up).
This formula yields the Battle Value of an infantry unit with 
the standard Gunnery 4 and Anti-’Mech 5 Skill Ratings. If the 
unit possesses higher or lower skill ratings, multiply the BV 
by the appropriate skill rating multiplier (see Constructing a 
Battle Force, p. 315). Remember that, for infantry units with 
the Mechanized Motive Type, as well as units which lack the 
Anti-’Mech Infantry kits referred to on page 155, the unit’s 
Anti-’Mech Skill should be treated as fixed at 8 for this purpose.


--- PAGE 312 ---
Multiply the Weapon Battle Rating by the Battle Armor’s 
Speed Factor
Multiply the battle armor’s Weapon Battle Rating by its Speed 
Factor as shown on the Speed Factor Table (see p. 316). Use the 
movement mode that gives the highest movement rate.
This calculation gives the battle armor unit’s final Weapon 
Battle Rating.
STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL BATTLE VALUE
The BV of a single suit of battle armor is calculated by adding 
the battle armor’s Defensive and Offensive Battle Ratings. To 
determine the BV for a squad / point / Level I, multiply this value by 
the Modifier for the appropriate size of battle armor unit from the 
Battle Armor Unit Size Modifier Table (p. 316). Inner Sphere squads 
usually contain four troopers, Clan Stars contain five troopers and 
a ComStar/Word of Blake Level I contains six troopers.
This formula yields the Battle Value of a battle armor unit with 
the standard Gunnery 4 and Anti-’Mech 5 Skill Ratings. If the unit 
possesses higher or lower skill ratings, multiply the BV by the appro-
priate skill rating multiplier (see Constructing a Battle Force, p. 315).

CALCULATING BATTLE ARMOR BV
The procedure for calculating the Battle Value (BV) of Battle 
Armor very similar to that for calculating the BV for ’Mechs and 
vehicles. The Defensive and Offensive Battle Ratings of the Battle 
Armor are determined and then combined to produce the final 
BV. In all cases retain fractions until reaching the final BV, then 
round to the nearest whole number (.5 rounds up). As you read 
each step, refer to page 310 and page 311 for an example of cal-
culating the BV for a Purifier unit and a Grenadier unit.
STEP 1: CALCULATE DEFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
First, ADD the following figures:
Total Armor Points x Armor BV (not including the 1 point for 
the warrior) + 1
Fire-resistant armor has a BV of 3.5; all other armor has a BV of 2.5.
Add 1 to the total for each of these systems the battle armor 
mounts (if any): Improved Sensors, Active Probes, or ECM.
Next, MULTIPLY the current value by the battle armor unit’s 
Defensive Factor. A battle armor unit’s Defensive Factor is based on 
its highest potential target movement modifier (including bonuses 
for jump capability and enhanced movement), as shown on the 
Defensive Factors Table (see p. 316). In addition, add to the Defensive 
Factor any appropriate modifiers from the Defensive Factor Modifier 
Table. The final result is the battle armor’s Defensive Battle Rating.
STEP 2: CALCULATE OFFENSIVE BATTLE RATING
Calculate Weapon Battle Rating
ADD the following:
Direct Fire Weapons Battle Rating: Add the BV of all direct-
fire weapons. Direct-fire weapons are all weapon systems except 
SRM launchers, advanced SRM launchers, MRM launchers, rocket 
launchers, LRM launchers, Narc (Compact) and Popup Mine. Do 
not factor BV for any ammunition used by direct fire weapons.
Missile Weapon Battle Rating: Calculate the Missile Weapon 
Battle Ratting for SRMs, advanced SRMs, MRMs, rocket launchers 
and LRMs. Use the BV of the launcher as normal. Calculate the 
ammunition BV for the kilograms of ammo carried proportionate 
to the BV for a full ton (1,000 kg) of that type of ammunition. That 
is, divide the kilograms of ammo carried by 1,000, and multiply 
the result by the BV of a full ton of the required ammunition type. 
Keep any fractional results.
Anti-’Mech Attacks: If the unit can perform Swarm Attacks, 
add the BV of all direct-fire weapons plus the BV of vibroclaws 
and/or claws and magnets that aid Swarm operations.
Anti-Personnel Weapons: Add the BV of anti-personnel weap-
ons from the Conventional Infantry Weapons BV Table on p. 319.
Squad Support Weapon: The BV of a Squad Support Weapon 
is equal to the total BV of the weapon divided by the number 
of troopers in the unit. Squad Support Weapons have their BV 
divided between all units, and so Inner Sphere units will only use 
1/4 of the BV, whereas a Clan unit uses 1/5 of the BV and ComStar/
Word of Blake units use 1/6.
Other Equipment: Add BV for other Offensive equipment. The 
final sum is the total Weapon Battle Rating.

CALCULATING AEROSPACE BV
The procedure for calculating the Battle Value (BV) of 
aerospace units is similar to that for ’Mechs. Determine the 
Defensive and Offensive Battle Ratings of the aerospace unit 
and combine them to produce the final BV. Retain fractions 
until reaching the final BV, then round to the nearest whole 
number (.5 rounds up). Refer to pp. 313–314 for an example 
of calculating BV for a TRB-D36 Thunderbird and a Dragau II.

First, ADD the following numbers.
Total Armor Factor x 2.5 (Fighters, DropShips, Small Craft)
(Support Vehicles: multiply by BAR ÷ 10)
Structural Integrity x 2.0
Total BV of all Defensive Equipment
Defensive Equipment includes screen launchers anti-missile 
systems and ECM (including ammo up to the BV of the sys-

2	 Add the BV of any ammunition and non-Defensive Equip-
ment on the unit to the running Weapon Battle Rating total.
3	 If the unit’s Total Weapon Heat is equal to or less than its Heat 
Efficiency, add the Modified BV of all the unit’s remaining 
weapons to the running Weapon Battle Rating total and pro-
ceed to Calculate Offensive Battle Rating. If the Total Weapon 
Heat is greater than the unit’s Heat Efficiency, start a running 
heat total, beginning at 0, and proceed to Step 4.
4	 Ignoring weapons that generate no heat when fired, choose 
the weapon on the unit that has the highest Modified BV. If 
more than one weapon has the same Modified BV, choose the 
one that generates the least heat when fired. If multiple weap-
ons of the same type are mounted, choose one randomly.
5	 Add this weapon’s Modified BV to the running Weapon Battle 
Rating total, and add its Heat Value to the running heat total.
6	 If the running heat total is less than the unit’s Heat Efficiency, 
repeat Steps 4-5 (ignoring any weapons already chosen). If 
the running heat total is equal to or has exceeded the Heat 
Efficiency, proceed to Step 7.
7	 The weapon that causes the Heat Efficiency to be equaled or 
exceeded is still calculated at its full Modified BV. All remain-
ing weapons are then added to the running Weapon Battle 
Rating total at half their Modified BV.
For DropShips: 
DropShips calculate their Weapon Battle Rating by firing arc, 
instead of by individual weapons, reflecting their firing by weapon 
bay and generating heat by firing arcs.
1	 Calculate individual firing arc BVs: First determine the total 
Modified BV of each individual firing arc (Nose, Aft, Fore 
(Wing) Left/Right, Aft (Rear Wing (Left/Right). Do not include 
ammunition or equipment at this time.
2	 Determine the “Front” firing arc: Compare these BV totals. The 
arc with the highest BV becomes the “Front” arc for calculat-
ing BV and Heat Efficiency.
3	 Calculate the BV for the “Front” arc: Add the BV of any ammu-
nition located in “Front” arc to the “Front” arc total. “Front” BV 
is always factored at 100% even if the DropShip will overheat 
firing the “Front” arc.
4	 Determine the “Left Side” firing arc: Look at the Battle Value 
of the two arcs adjacent to the “Front” arc. The one with the 
highest BV becomes the “Left Side” firing arc. If both arcs are 
of equal BV, choose one at random.
5	 Calculate the BV for the “Left Side” arc: Add the BV of ammunition 
in the “Left Side” to the BV total for that side obtained in Step 1. 
If the DropShip has exceeded its DropShip Heat Efficiency after 
firing the “Front” arc, multiply the “Left Side” arc BV by 0.5.
6	 Determine the “Right Side” firing arc: The remaining arc adja-
cent to the “Front” arc now becomes the “Right Side” firing arc.
7	 Calculate the BV for the “Right Side” arc: Add the BV of ammu-
nition in the “Right Side” to the BV total for that side obtained 
in Step 1. If the DropShip has not exceeded its DropShip Heat 
Efficiency after firing the “Left Side” arc, multiply the “Right 
Side” BV by 0.5. If the DropShip has exceeded its DropShip 
Heat Efficiency, then the multiply the “Right Side” BV by 0.25.
8	 Total remaining firing arcs: The remaining three arcs are now 
considered the “Rear” firing arc. Add the BV of ammunition 
in these arcs to the BV total for those arcs obtained in Step 1. 
Multiply the “Rear” BV by 0.25.
9	 Add the BV of any equipment with a BV rating.
Having followed Steps 1-7 (1-9 for DropShips), the result is 
the unit’s Weapon Battle Rating. Proceed to Calculate Offensive 
Battle Rating.
required adjustments for the Heat Efficiency and equipment to get 
the unit’s Weapon Battle Rating. Multiply the Weapon Battle Rating by 
the unit’s Speed Factor: the result is the Offensive Battle Rating.
Calculate Each Weapon’s Modified BV 
First, determine the Battle Value of each weapon and its ammu-
nition (if applicable) carried by the unit (see pp. 317-318). Then 
apply the following BV modifiers as necessary. All modifiers are 
cumulative. The result is the weapon’s Modified BV, which is used 
in the steps that follow.
Excessive Ammunition: To prevent excessive ammo from 
distorting the Battle Value, the BV added for ammunition cannot 
exceed the unmodified BV of the weapon itself. If the BV of the 
ammo exceeds the weapon BV, reduce the ammo BV to equal the 
unmodified weapon BV. When a unit carries several weapons of 
the same model, total the unmodified BV for all examples of that 
model and then the BV for all ammunition carried for that model 
before comparing the two BVs.
Rear-Firing Weapons: Aft-mounted weapons (but not their 
ammunition) count as half their normal BV value (aft-side arcs are 
not considered). If the unmodified BV of nose-mounted weapons 
is less than the unmodified BV of rear-firing weapons, then halve 
the value of the forward-firing weapons instead. When making 
heat adjustments to a weapon’s BV (see below), switch the nose- 
and aft-firing arcs in an identical manner. Note: DropShips do not 
use this modifier. 
Artemis IV FCS: Increase by 20 percent the BV of any missile 
launcher equipped with Artemis IV. This increase does not apply 
to the launcher’s ammunition.
Targeting Computer: Each weapon linked to a targeting 
computer (see p. 238) multiplies its BV by 1.25. Do not include 
ammunition when adjusting linked weapon BVs.
Determine Unit’s Heat Efficiency
For aerospace fighters, Small Craft and DropShips, a weapon’s 
Modified Battle Value may need to be reduced to take into consid-
eration the unit’s Heat Efficiency. The Heat Efficiency of a design is 
equal to its Heat Sink Capacity. Aerospace fighters and Small Craft 
add 6 to this value.
DropShip Heat Efficiency = Heat Sink Capacity
Aerospace Heat Efficiency = 6 + Heat Sink Capacity
Heat Sink Capacity: Heat Sink Capacity denotes the maximum 
number of Heat Points the unit can dissipate in a single turn. Each 
single heat sink dissipates 1 point of heat. Double heat sinks dis-
sipate 2 points of heat.
Determine Total Weapon Heat: Find and write down the total 
heat that the unit would generate if it fired all its offensive weap-
ons, including rear-firing weapons, in a single turn (Defensive 
Equipment is never figured in this value). Multiply by 2 the heat 
points generated by Ultra autocannons, multiply by 6 the heat 
points generated by rotary autocannons, reduce by half the heat 
points generated by Streak SRMs and reduce to one-quarter the 
heat points generated by one-shot weapons.
Calculate Weapon Battle Rating
For aerospace fighters, conventional fighters and Small Craft: 
Start a running Weapon Battle Rating total, beginning at 0. 
When instructed, add the specified amount to this total.
1	 Add the Modified BV of any weapon on the unit that does 
not generate heat when fired to the running Weapon Battle 
Rating total.

2. Determine Heat Efficiency and Total Weapon Heat
The Thunderbird has 25 single heat sinks. It is armed with 
3 Large Lasers (8 heat each), 2 LRM 20s (6 heat each) and 5 
Medium Lasers (3 heat each). Find its Heat Efficiency and Total 
Weapon Heat.

Unit Heat Efficiency = 6 + 25 = 31
 Total Weapon Heat = 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 51
Because the Total Weapon Heat is higher than the Heat 
Efficiency, its weapons must be sorted in order of Modified BV 
and a running heat total tracked to determine when weapon 
BVs should be halved. Ammunition is still handled as normal.
4 tons LRM 20 ammunition:
(4 x 23) = 92
LRM 20:

3. Calculate Offensive Battle Rating
Multiply the Thunderbird’s Weapon Battle Rating by its Speed 
Factor. With a Maximum Thrust of 8, its Speed Factor is 1.37.

915 x 1.37 = 1,253.55

Offensive Battle Rating = 1,253.55


678 + 1,253.55 = 1,931.55

TRB-D36 Thunderbird BV = 1,932
Calculate Offensive Battle Rating
Determine Unit’s Speed Factor: A unit’s Speed Factor 
reflects its ability to maneuver on the battlefield. To find the 
Speed Factor of any aerospace unit, cross-reference its Maxi-
mum Thrust Value with the Speed Factor Table (p. 316). 
Multiply the Total Battle Rating by the Speed Factor to find 
the unit’s Offensive Battle Rating.
Airships: Use the Maximum Thrust rating for airships, but 
round up to the next whole number for vehicles with frac-
tional thrust ratings.
STEP 3: CALCULATE FINAL BATTLE VALUE
An aerospace unit’s final BV is calculated by adding its 
Defensive and Offensive Battle Ratings. Round any remaining 
fractions to the nearest whole number (.5 rounds up).

1. Calculate Each Weapon’s Modified BV
The Thunderbird is armed with 3 Large Lasers, 2 LRM 20s and 
5 Medium Lasers. It has no special equipment that modifies 
the BV of its weapons, but two of its Medium Lasers are rear-
firing. Its LRM ammo does not exceed the BV of the launchers, 
and so does not have to be modified.

Because the two adjacent arcs are identical Wing arcs, the left 
one is chosen as the “Left Side” arc. As the Dragau’s “Front Side” 
does not exceed its Heat Efficiency, this “Side” is calculated at 
100% of its total BV. Had the Heat Efficiency been exceeded, the

The right wing becomes the “Right Side” arc. As the Dragau has 
still not exceeded its Heat Efficiency, the “Right Side” is calculated

The Dragau’s Nose arc generates the greatest BV. This makes 
the Nose the “Front” of the DropShip. Now that this has been 
determined, add the BV of ammunition in that arc and calculate 
the Nose Weapon Battle Rating. The “Front” is always calculated 
at 100% BV, even if it exceeds the Heat Efficiency (244) of 
the DropShip.

SKILL RATINGS
When assembling a battle force, a player can elect to use 
different skill ratings for selected units. However, selecting 
better skill ratings correspondingly increases the BV of that 
unit. Conversely, selecting worse skill ratings will reduce the 
units’ overall BV.
ProtoMechs: Because ProtoMech pilots have no Piloting 
Skill, use the 5 column of the BV Skill Multiplier Table when 
determining skill modifiers for non-standard troops.
Mechanized Infantry: Because they cannot perform anti-
’Mech attacks, mechanized infantry can only adjust their 
Gunnery Skill Rating (use the 5 column of the BV Skill Multi-
plier Table for this purpose).
Anti-’Mech Default Skill: Unless the unit has an Anti-’Mech 
Infantry Kit (see p. 155), all non-mechanized conventional 
infantry have a default Anti-’Mech Skill Rating of 8, which can-
not be improved.
CONSTRUCTING A BATTLE FORCE
A battle force is a collection of units (including but not lim-
ited to BattleMechs, Combat Vehicles, ProtoMechs, infantry, 
battle armor and aerospace fighters). The methods presented 
previously can provide the base Battle Value for any unit with 
a standard skill/experience level.
This BV is adjusted to reflect the effectiveness of the battle 
force’s target acquisition gear; command, control and com-
munications systems; and skill rating. Apply these modifiers 
in the order listed.
TARGET ACQUISITION GEAR (TAG)
Any unit in the battle force equipped with TAG, Light TAG or a 
C3 Master Computer adds BV equal to the BV of each ton of semi-
guided LRM ammunition carried in the force (use the ammo BV 
for the appropriate-size LRM launcher). Units whose only such 
piece of equipment is rear-mounted add half the BV instead.
COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS (C3)
Two or more units in a battle force equipped with C3 systems 
can be designated as part of a C3 network (see Total Warfare, p. 
131). Add 5 percent of the total BV of all units in a C3 network 
to each of the units linked by each network.
EXTERNAL STORES
Aerospace fighters, conventional aircraft and some Sup-
port Vehicles may carry additional weapons and equipment 
on external hard points (see the Aerospace Weapons and 
Equipment BV Table, p. 318). The BV of any external stores is 
added to the base BV of a unit before the base BV is modified 
for skill rating.
Aerospace fighters can carry a maximum of one bomb per 5 
tons of mass. Support Vehicles can carry one bomb per hard-
point added during design.

To calculate the Speed Factors for movement not shown on the table, use the following formula: 
Speed Factor = (1 + ((Running MP + (Jump MP ÷ 2) – 5) ÷10))1.2
If the unit has MASC or triple-strength myomer (but not industrial triple-strength myomer), 
use the maximum MP it can generate utilizing that equipment. Round off the result to two 
decimal places.
DEFENSIVE FACTORS TABLE 
* Including bonuses for jump capability, enhanced movement capability from MASC or triple-strength 
myomer, and any VTOL movement modifier. Do not add the +1 to-hit penalty used in attacks against 
battle armor units. For units with detachable missile packs, use the best modifier for movement.

**The damage used to calculate the item’s BV is based on the final 
damage the item can deal after all possible modifications (such 
as TSM) are applied.
† Defensive Battle Rating
§ Ammunition for these weapons is not counted as explosive.
‡ Treat as Gauss weapon when calculating defensive battle rating.
NOTES 
A 	 TAG: Only affects a unit’s BV if it or other friendly units carry 
equipment that can be used in conjunction with it. See Con-
structing a Battle Force, p. 315.
B 	 Artemis IV FCS: Increase by 20 percent the BV of any missile 
launcher equipped with Artemis IV. This increase does not apply 
to the launcher’s ammunition. 
C 	 CASE/MASC/Triple-Strength Myomer, Industrial Triple-
Strength Myomer: Though these items are used when 
calculating Battle Ratings, they have no individual BV. 
D 	 C3 Computers/Slaves and Improved C3 Computers: C3 
Computers and Slaves (or Improved C3Computers) only affect 
a unit’s BV if the unit is designated as part of a complete C3 
network (at least one C3 Master and one Slave, or two Improved 
C3 Computers). See Constructing a Battle Force, p. 315.
E 	 Targeting Computer: The BV of a targeting computer equals 
25 percent of the total BV of all weapons linked to the computer. 
Do not include the BV of ammo when calculating this sum, and 
use half the BV ratings of rear-mounted weapons.
F 	 BV is the total BV of all weapons in a machine gun array multi-
plied by 0.67.

*A result of 2 or 12 (or an 8 if the attack strikes the side) may inﬂict a critical hit on the vehicle. For each result of 2 or
12 (or 8 for side attacks), apply damage normally to the armor in that section. The attacking player then automatically rolls
once on the Ground Combat Vehicle Critical Hits Table below (see Combat, p. 192 in Total Warfare for more information).
A result of 12 on the Ground Combat Vehicles Hit Location Table may inﬂict critical hit against the turret; if the vehicle has 
no turret, a 12 indicates the chance of a critical hit on the side corresponding to the attack direction.
†The vehicle may suffer motive system damage even if its armor remains intact. Apply damage normally to the armor in 
that section, but the attacking player also rolls once on the Motive System Damage Table at right (see Combat, p. 192 in 
Total Warfare for more information). Apply damage at the end of the phase in which the damage takes effect.
§Side hits strike the side as indicated by the attack direction. For example, if an attack hits the right side, all Side results 
strike the right side armor. If the vehicle has no turret, a turret hit strikes the armor on the side attacked.

*All movement and Driving Skill Roll penalties are cumulative. However, each Driving Skill Roll
modiﬁer can only be applied once. For example, if a roll of 6-7 is made for a vehicle, inﬂicting 
a +1 modiﬁer, that is the only time that particular +1 can be applied; a subsequent roll of 6-7 
has no additional effect. This means the maximum Driving Skill Roll modiﬁer that can be 
inﬂicted from the Motive System Damage Table is +6. If a unit’s Cruising MP is reduced
to 0, it cannot move for the rest of the game, but is not considered an immobile target. In 
addition, all motive system damage takes effect at the end of the phase in which the damage 
occurred. For example, if two units are attacking the same Combat Vehicle during the 
Weapon Attack Phase and the ﬁrst unit inﬂicts motive system damage and rolls a 12, the –4 
immobile target modiﬁer would not apply for the second unit. However, the –4 modiﬁer would 
take effect during the Physical Attack Phase. If a hover vehicle is rendered immobile while 
over a Depth 1 or deeper water hex, it sinks and is destroyed.

*A result of 2 or 12 (or an 8 if the attack strikes the side) may inﬂict a critical hit on the VTOL. For each such attack, appl
y
damage normally to the armor in that section. The attacking player then immediately rolls once on the VTOL Combat Vehicle
Critical Hits Table, below.
†Damage Value / 10 (round up); see Rotor Hits, p. 197, Total Warfare. Additionally, damage to rotors slows down the
VTOL. Each hit reduces the VTOL’s Cruising MP by 1, meaning that the controlling player must also recalculate Flank MP;
